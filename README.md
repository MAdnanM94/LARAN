# Visualizaling political polarization over time from debate transcripts

Through an analysis of written transcriptions from U.S. presidential and vice-presidential debates, we make progress toward determining terminology and rhetoric that is more commonly used by the Democratic or Republican political parties. We used various NLP models such as Naive Bayes, random forests, deep-learning transformer models (BERT) for classification of text polarity over time.
